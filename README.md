# Movie Stack App - ReactJS + TypeScript

## Introduction

This web application was developed by me, Tiago Carvalho, in the context of ITSector's React Academy final challenge.

Its purpose is to show a list of movies (including its name - title - and their poster - image), which can be filtered by viewing status ('All', 'Seen' or 'For Seen'), in an interactive and user-friendly way. It is also possible to add, edit and delete movies.

## Technologies

To initialize this project, a ReactJS + TypeScript + Vite template was used.

During the development process, the latest versions (as of March $18^th$ 2025) of the following technologies, packages and frameworks were handled:

* ReactJS
* TypeScript
* React-Bootstrap
* Zustand (for store management)
* Jest + React Testing Library (for unit testing)

## Run

To run this application locally, please run the following command in the prompt terminal

```npm run dev```

and open ```localhost:5173``` in your browser.
